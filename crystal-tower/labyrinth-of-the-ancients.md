## Bone Dragon

	/alliance Please don't talk for a second, I'm going to explain the fight.
	/wait 2
	/alliance There are 3 phases. The boss will die at the end of each phase and respawn.
	/alliance First and second phases: skeletons will spawn in the center, if they reach the dragon they will kill everybody.
	/wait 3
	/alliance MAIN TANK: Pull the dragon to the far end and keep him there. Same for all 3 phases.
	/alliance OFF-TANKS: When skeletons spawn, a tank needs to grab each one and pull it to the last platform of each column.
	/alliance Don't pull more than one skeleton to the same spot - if more than 1 skeleton dies in the same place, it will sprint to the boss and kill everybody.
	/alliance DPS: Skeletons > Dragon. Do not kill the dragon while skeletons are alive, they will sprint to the boss and kill everybody.
	/wait 5
	/alliance Third phase: eyes will spawn instead of skeletons. Unlike skeletons, they don't explode when they reach the boss.
	/alliance OFF-TANKS: Pick up eyes so they don't interrupt healers.
	/alliance DPS: Go all out on the boss.
	/alliance ...and that's it!

## Thanatos

	/alliance Please don't talk for a second, I'm going to explain the fight.
	/wait 2
	/alliance HEALERS: Keep the Magic Pots alive.
	/wait 3
	/alliance TANKS: Pick up Nemesis and keep away from Thanatos. If you're a ghost, tank Thanatos.
	/wait 3
	/alliance DPS: Sandman > Nemesis. If you're a ghost, go all out on Thanatos.
	/wait 3
	/alliance Basically, only ghosts can damage the boss. Pots turn you into ghosts, so protect the pots from adds.
	/alliance ...and that's it!

## King Behemoth

	/alliance Please don't talk for a second, I'm going to explain the fight.
	/wait 2
	/alliance HEALERS: Everybody takes continuous damage, there's no avoiding it. Gotta keep everyone topped up.
	/wait 2
	/alliance TANKS:
	/alliance 1 tank on King Behemoth
	/alliance 1 tank on Iron Giants. Keep them away from Comets and King Behemoth. VERY important you pick them up immediately.
	/alliance One tank on each of the 4 towers. Your job is to click the tower when it lights up.
	/wait 5
	/alliance DPS: Bombs > Iron Giant > King Behemoth
	/wait 2
	/alliance EVERYBODY: If you get a green dot over your head, a Comet is going to land where you stand. Stay towards the center, away from King Behemoth and Iron Giant.
	/alliance When King Behemoth roars, run behind a Comet. Keep it in line of sight between him and you.
	/alliance ...and that's it!
