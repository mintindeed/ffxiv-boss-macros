# Crystal Tower - Labyrinth of the Ancients
***
## Bone Dragon
/alliance Please don't talk for a second, I'm going to explain the fight.
/wait 2
/alliance There are 3 phases. The boss will die at the end of each phase and respawn. 
/alliance First and second phases: skeletons will spawn in the center, if they reach the dragon they will kill everybody.
/wait 3
/alliance MAIN TANK: Pull the dragon to the far end and keep him there. Same for all 3 phases.
/alliance OFF-TANKS: When skeletons spawn, a tank needs to grab each one and pull it to the last platform of each column.
/alliance Don't pull more than one skeleton to the same spot - if more than 1 skeleton dies in the same place, it will sprint to the boss and kill everybody.
/alliance DPS: Skeletons > Dragon. Do not kill the dragon while skeletons are alive, they will sprint to the boss and kill everybody.
/wait 5
/alliance Third phase: eyes will spawn instead of skeletons. Unlike skeletons, they don't explode when they reach the boss.
/alliance OFF-TANKS: Pick up eyes so they don't interrupt healers.
/alliance DPS: Go all out on the boss.
/alliance ...and that's it!

## Thanatos
/alliance Please don't talk for a second, I'm going to explain the fight.
/wait 2
/alliance HEALERS: Keep the Magic Pots alive.
/wait 3
/alliance TANKS: Pick up Nemesis and keep away from Thanatos. If you're a ghost, tank Thanatos.
/wait 3
/alliance DPS: Sandman > Nemesis. If you're a ghost, go all out on Thanatos.
/wait 3
/alliance Basically, only ghosts can damage the boss. Pots turn you into ghosts, so protect the pots from adds.
/alliance ...and that's it!
