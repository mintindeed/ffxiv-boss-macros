## Scylla

	/a This is Scylla, first boss. There can be balls following you, in that case:
	/wait 2
	/a Purple = Lightning = Go feed the ball into a lightning arc, each must have 3 charges
	/wait 1
	/a Blue = Ice = Go get frozen near your team platform (easier)
	/wait 1
	/a Red = Fire = Go unfreeze someone! A water puddle will then appear
	/wait 1
	/a Scylla can cast two big attacks:
	/wait 1
	/a Ancient Flare: go to a water puddle to get less damage, your healers will love you
	/wait 1
	/a Daybreak: *everyone* must go to their team platform to activate the barrier
	/wait 2
	/a Good luck! â™¥
