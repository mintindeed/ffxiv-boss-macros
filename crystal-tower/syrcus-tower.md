## Scylla

	/a This is Scylla, first boss. There can be balls following you, in that case:
	/wait 2
	/a Purple = Lightning = Go feed the ball into a lightning arc, each must have 3 charges
	/wait 1
	/a Blue = Ice = Go get frozen near your team platform (easier)
	/wait 1
	/a Red = Fire = Go unfreeze someone! A water puddle will then appear
	/wait 1
	/a Scylla can cast two big attacks:
	/wait 1
	/a Ancient Flare: go to a water puddle to get less damage, your healers will love you
	/wait 1
	/a Daybreak: *everyone* must go to their team platform to activate the barrier
	/wait 2
	/a Good luck! ♥

## Glasya Labolas

	/a Second boss, Glasya Labolas!
	/wait 2
	/a When first lasers appear, get into their circles to disable them, then if you're not trapped DPS them.
	/wait 2
	/a When second lasers appear, tank the robots near their spawn point (waymarks), they can only die when linked to lasers.
	/wait 2
	/a When all robots are dead, you can jump to the sides; DPS the rooks to be able to come back kick the big ass.
	/wait 2
	/a Rinse and repeat. Good luck! ♥

## Amon

	/a Third boss, Amon!
	/wait 2
	/a When slimes spawn, DPS them as fast as possible.
	/wait 2
	/a When Kum Kums spawn, feed the purple balls to them to kill them faster.
	/wait 2
	/a When you are transformed to a toad, *don't use your attack*, just wait for your mates to kill the snakes.
	/wait 2
	/a When ice blocks snare people, hide behind them, boss is about to use his big attack!
	/wait 2
	/a Good luck! ♥

## Xande

	/a Xande, finally!
	/wait 2
	/a When yellow balls appear, we need one person in each circle.
	/wait 2
	/a When he disappears, DPS adds on the side, then the one in the middle; use melee LB on the 2nd wave if really needed.
	/wait 2
	/a Pay attention to black circles, enter them when they pop, damage is split between everyone in it, and then an area to protect us will appear.
	/wait 2
	/a Have fun on this last one! ♥
